            “But they’re part of our family,” pet lovers frequently insist. How? You didn’t give birth to them. You can talk to them but they can’t talk back, and if you imagine for one second that your cat really gives a damn about your feelings then you’re sorely misguided. If cats do consider you at all, it’s probably to think: “What strange creatures these human animals are; many take better care of us than they do their own young.”
